# 🌍 Global Demographic Trend Analysis & Strategic Insights

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes global population data from 1960 onwards to identify long-term demographic trends, regional growth patterns, and data-driven insights. The objective is to transform raw population datasets into meaningful analytical outputs that support strategic planning, forecasting, and market intelligence.

The analysis focuses on identifying population growth rates, regional variations, and trend shifts over time using data analytics and visualization techniques.
